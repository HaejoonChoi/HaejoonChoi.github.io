# Conceptual Data Modeling

### 1. Identify entities and attributes 

-   entities should contain descriptive information
-   multivalued attributes should be classified as entitie

#### 2. Define relationships [binary, unary, ternary] and cardinalities [min..max]

#### 3. Associate attributes with entities or relationships

#### 4. Determine attribute domains

#### 5. Determine candidate keys and primary keys

#### 6. Identify generalization hierarchies (optional step) if appropriate/helpful

#### 7. Check model for redundancies and traps

#### 8. Validate model against transactions

#### 9. Integrate into global model (optional)

#### 10. Review with users





# View Integration

-   Diversity occurs when different users developed their own unique perspectives of the database view

-   #### Four basic steps:

    -   Preintegration analysis
    -   Comparison of schemas
    -   Conformation of schemas
    -   Merging and restructuring of schemas
